  Hello, my name is Geon Kim and I am a graduate student majoring in Computer Science at KAIST.
  Currently, I am affiliated with the CDSN Lab at KAIST, and my research interests include building IoT-based distributed systems for smart services. 
  Specifically, I am studying preference learning in IoT-based smart spaces. 
  Preference learning involves using IoT sensors and actuators to gather data on user interactions, and then using RL to learn the user's preferred environment and how to control the system to reach that environment.
  Now, I am working on researching how to improve the level of personalization by incorporating IoT devices and user's personal information from visual data to learn user-state specific preferences, rather than single averaged preferences.
  In regards to this topic, I am working on my thesis which focuses on improving the control of robots to find the optimal observation position for personalized user-state sensing in real-world environments using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL).

          The goal of this project is to develop a research assistant tool for a neuro-science laboratory that will automatically annotate the onset point of a rat's muscular reaction when stimulated. 
          The lab was previously burdened with manually annotating these points, so they need the assistant tool that can annotate at a human level of accuracy. 
          I focused on finding the best method for estimating the onset point of muscular reaction from EMG signals by comparing four different algorithms (Linear Envelope, TKEO, Sample Entropy, Integrated Profile) in terms of their Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the estimated point and ground truth, as well as their running time. 
          Additionally, I created a GUI-based interface to make it easy for researchers to use the estimation method.

            As a master student, I studyed IoT-based smart service. The main research point was RL-based preference learning system in IoT-enriched space; system that captures user's personalized preference from interaction between user and space, and provides user preferable environmental state.
            In addtion, I adopted the mobile service robot as a tool to increase the space intelligence for capturing more accurate user preference.
